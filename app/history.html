              <h3>Colonel Waring and the "White Wings"</h3>
              <p>The story of New York's modern waste system starts with the creation of the Department of Street Cleaning (DSC) in 1881, which would become the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) in 1929.</p>
              <p>During its first years, the DSC was unable to offer a solution to the pressing issue of street cleaning. This was because it shared responsability for cleaning with other City agencies, and had very little oversight of its contracts.</p>

              <h3>Sweeping and collection</h3>
              <p>Waring's first challenge was to ensure that the DSC was actually cleaning the streets and collecting garbage. To do this, he reorganized DSC's labor force and its practices.</p>
              <p>Waring instituted a military-like hierarchy, with a clear chain of command and well-defined responsabilities for workers.</p>

              <p>Waring also issued white uniforms to sweepers, who became known as the "white wings". He had them work alongside drivers, quickly loading the garbage into horse-drawn carts.</p>

              <h3>Disposal: ocean dumping</h3>
              <p>In the very early days of New York City, waste was disposed of in the Hudson and East Rivers, sometimes being used to expand the shoreline.</p>
              <p>When Colonel Waring took over the DSC in 1885, NYC's waste production had grown so much that almost all of it was dumped into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
              <!-- <p>While Waring recognized that ocean dumping was a poor practice, it would take decades before DSC was able to fully move away from it.</p> -->

              <h3>Looking for alternatives</h3>
              <p>To move away from ocean dumping, Waring specified that waste should be separated into three categories that could be disposed of using other methods. He even created one of the city’s first (if short-lived) municipal recycling programs.</p>
              <p>Organic material was turned into fertilizer; paper and rags were recovered for their market value. The resulting material was either incinerated or landfilled along with ash.</p>

              <p>Despite the increasing reliance on ocean dumping, the use of waste as fill to expand shorelines and create islands remained common throughout the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
              <p>This method, called "land reclamation," had a double benefit: it was perceived as more sanitary than ocean dumping, and created land which could be used or sold.</p>

              <p>Following the ban, New York had a network of 89 active landfills and 22 incinerators that it would come to rely on for decades.

              <p>At the peak of its operation in 1986-87, Fresh Kills received up to 29,000 tons of waste per day. Today, it occupies 2,200 acres and holds about 150 million tons of waste.

              <h3>A fundamental split</h3>
              <p>With Fresh Kills landfill almost full in the 1990's, the city decided to raise costs for private companies to dipose of their waste there.</p>
              <p>These companies reacted by creating a network of in-city "transfer stations." In those transfer stations, waste was placed on larger trucks and then sent to cheaper landfills outside of the city.</p>

              <p>These private transfer stations were built on land zoned for industrial use, many times near poor communities and communities of color.</p>
              <p>To this day, despite efforts from the City to pursue a more equitable distribution, most of the private transfer stations are still clustered in a few areas of NYC.

              <p>In 1996, the City pleged to close Fresh Kills landfill in five years, due to intense community pressure</p>
              <p>After Fresh Kills was finally closed in 2001, the City began using private transfer stations to send all of its waste outside of NYC. This meant increased reliance on trucks for waste export, leading to more traffic and air polution.</p>

              <p>Designed by the landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations, the park is expected to be completed in 2037.</p>

              <p>Today, the City is trying to deal with the legacy of its waste history.</p>
              <p>It still sends all of its waste outside the city (and mostly to landfills), but is increasing the use of rail and barge transportation to reduce pollution.</p>
              <p>The City is also building new marine transfer stations to reduce their concentration in the city.</p>

              <p>In 2015, the City pledged to to eliminate all waste sent to landfills by the year 2030. This will require a great increase in alernatives to landfilling, such as recycling and composting.

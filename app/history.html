              <h3>Colonel Waring and the "White Wigs"</h3>
              <p>The modern story of New York's waste starts with the creation of the Department of Street Cleaning (DSC) in 1881.</p>
              <p>During its first years, the DSC was unable to offer a solution to the pressing issue of street cleaning.</p>
              <p>It was only in 1885 when the reformed Civil War Colonel George Waring took over the DSC that things began to change.</p>

              <h3>Sweeping and collection</h3>
              <p>Waring first challenge was to ensure that the DSC was actually cleaning the streets and collecting garbage.</p>
              <p>To do this, Waring reorganized DSC's labor force and its practices.</p>
              <p>He issued white uniforms to sweepers (which became known as the "white wings") and had them work alongside drivers, loading the garbage into horse pulled carts.</p>

              <h3>Transfering waste to boats</h3>
              <p>Carts loaded with waste were driven to wharves on the waterfront. There, they were tipped onto large, flat bottomed boats, called scows.</p>

              <p>When Colonel Waring took over the DSC in 1885, most of its waste was dumped from scows into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
              <p>While Waring recognized that ocean dumping was a poor practice, it would take decades before DSC was able to fully move away from it.</p>

              <p>There, scows were emptied manually. Some of the debris floated and eventually ended back in beaches and rivers.</p>

              <h3>Looking for alternatives</h3>
              <p>To move away from ocean dumping, Waring specified that waste should be separated waste into three categories which could use other diposal methods.</p>
              <p>Organic material was turned into fertilizer at plants outside of the city; paper and rags were recovered for their market value; and the resulting rubbish was either incinerated or landfilled along with ash.</p>

              <h3>Disposal: building land on waste</h3>
              <p>As an alternative to ocean dumping, waste was used as landfill to expand shorelines or to create islands. This was a common practice in NYC until the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
              <p>This method, often called "land reclamation," had a double benefit: it was seen as more sanitary than ocean dumping, and created land which could be used or sold.</p>

              <p>These private companies reacted by creating a network of in-city "transfer stations." Inside transfer stations, waste was placed on larger trucks and sent it to cheaper landfills in other cities and states.</p>

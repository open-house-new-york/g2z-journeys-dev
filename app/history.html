              <h3>Colonel Waring and the "White Wings"</h3>
              <p>The story of New York's modern waste system starts with the creation of the Department of Street Cleaning (DSC) in 1881.</p>
              <p>During its first years, the DSC was unable to offer a solution to the pressing issue of street cleaning. Several factors hindered its efficiency, including shared the responsability of cleaning the streets with several other City agencies, and the lack of oversight of its contracts.</p>

              <h3>Sweeping and collection</h3>
              <p>Waring's first challenge was to ensure that the DSC was actually cleaning the streets and collecting garbage. To do this, he reorganized DSC's labor force and its practices.</p>
              <p>Waring instituted a military-like hierarchy, with a clear chain of command and responsabilities for the cleaning of the city's newly defined sanitation sections.</p>

              <p>When Colonel Waring took over the DSC in 1885, NYC's waste production had grown so much that almost all of its waste was dumped into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

              <p>Organic material was turned into fertilizer at plants outside of the city; paper and rags were recovered for their market value; and the resulting rubbish was either incinerated or landfilled along with ash.</p>

              <p>This method, often called "land reclamation," had a double benefit: it was seen as more sanitary than ocean dumping, and created land which could be used or sold.</p>

              <p>These private transfer stations were built on land zoned for industrial use, many times near poor communities and communities of color.</p>
              <p>To this day, despite efforts from the City to pursue a more equitable distribution, most of the private transfer stations are still clustered in a few areas of NYC.

              <h3>The closure of Fresh Kills</h3>
              <p>In 1996, the City pleged to close Fresh Kills landfill in five years. It was then estimated that if the landfill was kept open, it would have become the highest point on the eastern seaboard.</p>
              <p>After Fresh Kills was finally closed in 2001, the City began using private transfer stations to send all of its waste outside of NYC. This meant increased reliance on trucks for waste export, leading to more truck traffic and air polution.</p>

              <p>Since its closure, Fresh Kills has been slated to become a park, which will be approximately three times the size of Central Park.</p>
              <p>Designed by the landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations, the park is expected to be completed in 2037.</p>

              <p>Today, the City is trying to deal with the legacy of its waste history. It has built new transfer stations, increasing the use of rail and barge transportation for waste disposal. These initiatives seek to reduce air polution and transfer station concentration.</p>

              <p>In 2015, the City pledged to to eliminate all waste sent to landfills by the year 2030. This will require increasing alernatives to landfilling, such as recycling and composting.

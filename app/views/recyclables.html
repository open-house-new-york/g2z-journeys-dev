                    <p>In New York City there is also a common practice of picking cans and bottles from curbside recyclables, street bins, and litter.</p>
                    <p>Known as canning, this activity is usually done by low-income people, who return the containers at retailers or redemption centers in exchange for a five-cent refund.</p>

                    <p>Beverage distributors will take back the containers and reimburse retailers and redemption centers, plus a 3.5 cent handling fee. They will then sell the containers to recyclers.</p>

                    <p>This facility will sort recyclables into several categories before shipping it to recyclers.
                      Therefore, it is technically not a recycling plant but a sorting plant, and is usually referred to as a "materials recovery facility" (MRF).</p>

                      The better the material can be separated, the more value can be obtained when selling it to recyclers.</p>
                    <p>Metals are recovered with magnets and electrical currents;
                      several mechanical processes separate glass, plastic film and paper.

                    <p>The values of the bundles are determined by market prices, and are related to a series of factors.
                      An important factor is the price of raw or so-called "virgin" material, such as oil.
                      Low prices for these materials usually mean that recyclables are valued less, since it will be relatively cheaper to make new materials.</p>

                    <p>While most of the metals and glass tends to be recycled domestically, much of the paper and plastics is sent on container ships to Asia for recycling.</p>

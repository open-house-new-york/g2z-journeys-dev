                      Most transfer stations are concentrated in a few areas in New York City, which were historically zoned for industrial use. These areas are largely home to low-income communities and communities of color.

                    <p>

                    <p>
                      Inside the transfer stations, collection trucks unload waste onto the tipping floor. Front end loaders will then place the waste into large containers, which will be transported by semi-trucks or trains to landfills and incinerators outside the city.

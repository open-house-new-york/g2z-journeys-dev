                    <h3>Debris and fill</h3>
                    <p>Construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris is generated by new constructions, renovations, land clearing, excavations, and demolitions. This includes work on buildings, roads, and utilities.</p>
                    <p>This type of waste is usually divided into two main categories: excavated earth, concrete, and stones (also called fill material); and another category for all other debris.</p>
                  </div>

                    <h3>Contractors and haulers</h3>
                    <p>On the job-site, contractors collect debris in containers, which are rented by private C&amp;D haulers. These containers vary widely in size, ranging in length from 1 to 20 yards.</p>
                    <p>As with other types of commercial waste, this part of the waste system is entirely private and thus not collected by DSNY.</p>

                    <h3>Source separation</h3>
                    <p>Some contractors will separate the debris into a series of materials, including metal, wood, masonry, and cardboard. In other cases, haulers will collect everything commingled, and materials may or may not be separate at a processing facility.</p>
                    <p>The capacity for source separation depends on a series of factors, including space constraints for different containers on the job-site; financial incentives from haulers; and job-site scheduling.</p>

                    <h3>The "mini" container</h3>
                    <p>The yard-long, "mini" container is commonly used in job-sites in New York City, usually due to space constraints.</p>
                    <p>Here, we see containers source-separated for metals, a material with high recycling value, being collected by a private hauler.</p>
                    <p>The rear-loader trucks usually have cables or mechanical arms that lift and tip the containers.</p>

                    <h3>To a processing facility or transfer station</h3>
                    <p>When collection trucks are full, they head to a C&amp;D debris processing facility or to a transfer station. The main difference between the two is that processing facilities will try to recover certain materials from the debris for recycling or for use as landfill cover, while materials arriving at a transfer station almost always end up in landfills or incinerators.</p>
                    <p>Haulers in New York City can use one of the more than 40 processing facilities located in the city, as well as many other facilities in Long Island, Upstate New York, or New Jersey.</p>

                    <p>C&amp;D debris processing facilities are similar in many ways to waste transfer stations. They are primarily logistical centers for debris, consolidating loads from smaller trucks into bigger ones before sending it outside of the city.</p>
                    <p>Because C&amp;D facilities handle materials different from the ones received at transfer stations, they are subject to different regulations by the State's Department of Environmental Conservation. One of the regulations is to control dust, and in order to comply with this many facilities will hose the debris with water.</p>

                    <p>Materials that can be used as landfill cover are also separated, such as excavated earth, concrete and stones, known as fill material.</p>

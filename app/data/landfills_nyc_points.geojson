Refuse was buried under a layer of soil, thus containing it and making it available for productive use. In 1924 all barge-fed waste was brought to the island and after 14 years of use, Riker's Island had grown to more than twice its original size and became home to a population of rats - some the size of cats - and spontaneous fires and explosions so that the ground resembled a sea of small volcanoes. At it's peak, the island's waste heaps reached over 100 feet above sea level. After much of the waste was moved to construct LaGuardia airport, the island became the site of the city's jail in 1935 and many early buildings on the site, still in use today, suffer structural damage from being built on unstable soil.","image":"http://i.imgur.com/XqoTIY1.jpg?1"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.009271,40.673624]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":8,"name":"Red Hook","text":"This image shows a squatter's colony on the site of a dump in Red Hook in 1931.","image":"http://i.imgur.com/RG0jpMq.jpg?1"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.792763,40.868483]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":10,"name":"Pelham Bay Park","text":"Under Robert Moses' \"Sanitation, Reclamation, Recreation\" plan, Orchard Beach was created from a barge-fed landfill with sand added from Sandy Hook, New Jersey and the Rockaways.

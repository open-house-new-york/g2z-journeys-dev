        <h3>When you throw something away in New York City, where does it actually go?</h3>
        <p><i>Waste Journeys</i> is a series of side-scrolling digital features created to help New Yorkers
          understand where their waste goes when they throw it “away,” and exactly how it gets there.</p>
        <p>
          Different types of waste follow very different paths depending on where they enter the waste stream.
          You are likely most familiar with what's called the residential waste stream. On average, each New Yorker
          generates about <span class="highlight">15 pounds of waste each week at home</span>, adding up to
          around <span class="highlight">3 million tons</span> of waste citywide each year. This residential wastestream
          is handled directly by the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY), along with waste generated
          by municipal and many non-profit sites. In all, the DSNY is directly responsible for collecting
          around <span class="highlight">3.6 million tons</span><sup>1</sup>  of waste each year, including residential waste.
          This is the part of the system addressed by the City’s 0x30 campaign to eliminate waste to landfills by the year 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the residential and institutional waste handled by the DSNY represents just about
          <span class="highlight">27%</span> of the city’s overall waste stream. Waste generated at
          commercial, industrial, and construction sites is not collected or disposed
          of by the DSNY, but by hundreds of private carting companies. Commercial sites in the five
          boroughs generate <span class="highlight">3.5 million tons</span><sup>2</sup> of waste each year. The
          largest part of the waste stream, however, is Construction Debris, which
          accounts for a staggering <span class="highlight">6 million tons</span><sup>3</sup> of waste each year,
          or <span class="highlight">1.6 pound</span> for every pound that you generate at home.
          New York’s goal of becoming a truly zero waste city will require innovative
          approaches to the <span class="highlight">73%</span> of the waste stream not currently handled by the municipal system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further complicating matters, the private carting firms that handle commercial, industrial,
          and C&amp;D waste rely on long-haul trucking to transport waste, and many have located their
          transfer stations in industrial areas; approximately <span class="highlight">60%</span><sup>4</sup> of
          the city’s waste is carted by companies located in one of just three areas: the South Bronx,
          the North Brooklyn neighborhoods along Newtown Creek, and Southeast Queens. All of those trucks
          transporting waste from various sites to transfer stations,
          from transfer stations to far-flung landfills, and the methane emitted at these landfills generate
          an estimated <span class="highlight">5 million tons</span><sup>5</sup> of carbon emissions every
          year—<span class="highlight">10%</span> of the city’s carbon footprint.
          For our city to even begin to address this massive environmental challenge,
          we must first understand how the current system works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seven Journeys will be rolled out over the next few months, starting with
          features detailing the evolution of the city’s physical waste infrastructure
          over the past century, and the journey taken by your average piece of household waste on its way to
          distant landfills.

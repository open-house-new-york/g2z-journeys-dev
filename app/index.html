        <h3 class="no-margin">When you throw something away in New York City, where does it go?</h3>
        <p class="intro-paragraph"><i>Waste Journeys</i> is a series of side-scrolling digital features created to help New Yorkers
          understand where waste goes when it is thrown “away” and how it gets there.</p>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          Different types of waste follow very different paths depending on where they enter the waste stream.
          You are likely most familiar with what is called the residential waste stream. On average, each New Yorker
          generates about <span class="bold">15 pounds of waste each week at home</span>, adding up to
          around <span class="bold">3 million tons</span> of waste citywide each year. This residential waste stream
          is handled directly by the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY), along with waste generated
          by municipal and many non-profit sites. In all, DSNY is directly responsible for collecting
          around <span class="bold">3.6 million tons</span> of waste each year, including residential waste.<sup>1</sup>
          This is the part of the system addressed by the City’s 0x30 campaign to eliminate waste to landfills by the year 2030.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          But the residential and institutional waste handled by DSNY represents just about
          <span class="bold">a quarter</span> of the city’s overall waste stream.<sup>2</sup> Waste generated at
          commercial, industrial, and construction sites is not collected or disposed
          of by DSNY, but by hundreds of private carting companies. For every pound that DSNY collects from residential and
          institutional sites, another three are generated at sites outside of the municipal system.
          Commercial sites in the five
          boroughs generate <span class="bold">3.5 million tons</span> of waste each year—or roughly
           10 times the weight of the Empire State Building.<sup>3</sup> The
          largest part of the waste stream, however, is construction debris, which
          accounts for a staggering <span class="bold">6 million tons</span> of waste each year.
          New York’s goal of becoming a truly zero waste city will require innovative
          approaches to the <span class="bold">three-quarters</span> of the waste stream not currently handled directly by DSNY.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          Further complicating matters, the private carting firms that handle commercial, industrial,
          and construction and demolition waste rely on long-haul trucking to transport waste, and many have located their
          transfer stations in industrial areas. Approximately <span class="bold">60%</span> of
          the city’s waste is carted by companies located in one of just three areas: the South Bronx,
          the North Brooklyn neighborhoods along Newtown Creek, and Southeast Queens.<sup>5</sup> All of those trucks
          transporting waste from various sites to transfer stations,
          from transfer stations to far-flung landfills, and the methane emitted at these landfills, together, generate
          an estimated <span class="bold">5 million tons</span> of carbon emissions every
          year—<span class="bold">10%</span> of the city’s carbon footprint—disproportionately
           affecting the largely low-income communities that sit directly adjacent to the
           industrial areas where transfer stations are clustered.<sup>6</sup>
          For our city to even begin to address this massive environmental challenge,
          we must first understand how the current system works.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          Seven Waste Journeys will be released over the next few months that help explain where different kinds of
          waste go when they are thrown away in New York City. The series starts by tracing the journey of the everyday
          trash we throw away at home and on the street, and will continue in the coming weeks by looking at
          how the city handles recyclables, organic waste, commercial waste, and more.
